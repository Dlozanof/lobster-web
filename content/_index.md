{{< left_justify_text text="Welcome! During Lobster development I'll be using this website to post blog entries as a way of documenting the history of the project. I was taking notes locally, so might as well publish them.">}}


{{< callout img="neeon_girl2.png" text="Cool! But, what is Lobster?.">}}

{{< left_justify_text text="Glad you asked! I can tell you this: it is NOT an operating system nor an RTOS. It provides a small execution framework that I am making as a way to learning a bit of the internal of commonly used RTOS. It is written in Rust and focuses in providing a simple way to writting applications that handle data flows.">}}


{{< callout img="neeon_girl2.png" text="I see. I do not feel you answered the question though.">}}

{{< left_justify_text text="Well... With it you can define a data structure that will be provided by a certain peripheral, and then just wait for it to come. From application point of view no peripheral handling has to be done, you just receive the structs you expect (using Rust futures) and process them as you need.">}}
